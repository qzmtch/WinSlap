WinSlap is primarily developed for my own use cases. Feel free to use it under any terms the license permits. However, I can not guarantee that it works as intended, doesn't break your system or is actively maintained.

## Goals

 1. Apply tweaks to a fresh installation of Windows 10 after using a clean retail image (if you're looking to apply tweaks during installation, check out image creation tools)
 2. No bloat. WinSlap does what it's features list says and nothing else.
